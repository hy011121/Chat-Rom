# Simple Chat App

Simple Chat App is a simple application for communicating between users. This application allows users to log in and register, send messages, and view messages that have been sent.

## Feature

1. **Login**: Users can log in using the registered username and password.

2. **Registration**: Users can create a new account by registering a username and password.

3. **User Profile**: Users can edit their profile by changing the password.

4. **Sending Messages**: Users can send messages to the chat room.

5. **Responsive Design**: The appearance of the application is adapted to the user's device, both desktop and mobile.
- There is still a lot of unfinished CSS, so my recommendation is to create external CSS to improve the appearance

## Code Structure

- **login.php**: Login page for users.

- **chat.txt**: File contains conversation history saved in text format.

## Technology Used

- **PHP**: Programming language for application logic and interaction with servers.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and appearance of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions on the client side, for example handling links to tagged messages.
- **File System**: To store user data and conversation history.
